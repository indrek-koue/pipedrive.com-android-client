This is Aadroid test client for sales management software www.pipedrive.com


The assignment: 
Create an Android client using https://developers.pipedrive.com/v1

Goals:
*Login (using username and password)
*user session saved for later
*show pipedrive contacts, 
*ability to open a contact for detailed view (with pagination)



Remarks from the developer:
*UI is very very primitive, emphasis was put on correctesness and functionality of the application.

*No consistent downloads and requests. Every time an activity is killed-created the request is redone. Currently I don't see it as a big problem becuse the data amounts are small and fresness of the data is important.
